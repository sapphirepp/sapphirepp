                  numerically solve the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck equation for
                  astrophysical applications. Sapphire++ employs a numerical
                  algorithm based on a spherical harmonic expansion of the
                  distribution function, expressing the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck
                  equation as a system of partial differential equations
                  governing the evolution of the expansion coefficients. The
                  code utilises the discontinuous Galerkin method in conjunction
                  with implicit and explicit time stepping methods to compute
                  these coefficients, providing significant flexibility in its
                  choice of spatial and temporal accuracy. We showcase the
                  code's validity using examples. In particular, we simulate the
                  acceleration of test particles at a parallel shock and compare
                  the results to analytical predictions. The Sapphire++ code
                  Image 1 is available as a free and open-source tool for the
                  community.}
