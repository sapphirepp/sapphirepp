In our experience the complexity of developing @sapphire is strongly reduced if
an integrated development environment (IDE) is used. An IDE can be thought of as
a software suite that comprises tools to handle the different tasks appearing
when writing software. In particular, an IDE allows users to easily navigate the
many source files a project may exist of, integrates version control systems
like [git](https://git-scm.com/), unifies the format of the code and provides
users with a front-end to a debugger, e.g. [gdb](https://sourceware.org/gdb/).
