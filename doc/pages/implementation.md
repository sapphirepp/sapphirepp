 1. @subpage boundary-conditions  
    The possible choices for boundary conditions in @sapphire are explained
    and illustrated with examples.
 2. @subpage radiation-reaction  
    This section describes the numerical implementation of the
    radiation–reaction term in the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck framework.  
    It details how the Landau–Lifshitz formulation is introduced into the
    momentum-space operator, enabling radiative energy losses of
    relativistic particles in a magnetic field.
