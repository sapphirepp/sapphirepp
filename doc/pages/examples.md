 1. @subpage scattering-only  
    This example acts as an introduction to @sapphire. It uses the scattering
    term in the VFP equation to arrive at a simple test showing the usage of
    @sapphire.
 2. @subpage gyro-motion-f0  
    In this example, we demonstrate how an isotropic distribution of particles
    gyrate in a B-field.
