# About {#about}

@sapphire is an acronym and stands for \"<strong>S</strong>imulating
<strong>a</strong>strophysical <strong>p</strong>lasmas and
<strong>p</strong>articles with <strong>hi</strong>ghly
<strong>r</strong>elativistic <strong>e</strong>nergies in
C<strong>++</strong>\".

It is a code to simulate the interaction of charged particles with a background
plasma, a typical example is the propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays. To
this end it solves a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation in mixed coordinates,
namely

$$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot \nabla_{x} f -
  \gamma m \frac{\mathrm{D} \mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{D} t} \cdot \nabla_{p}f -
  \mathbf{p} \cdot\nabla_{x} \mathbf{u}\cdot \nabla_{p} f +
  q \mathbf{v} \cdot \left( \mathbf{B} \times \nabla_{p} f \right) =
  \frac{\nu}{2} \Delta_{\theta, \varphi} f + S\, .
$$

$f$ is the distribution function of the particles, i.e. their number density in
phase space. $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity of the background plasma, e.g. the
velocities of a plasma around a collisionless shock as observed after supernova
explosions. Note that the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ is given in mixed coordinates,
meaning it is defined relative to the background field $\mathbf{u}$.
$\mathbf{B}$ is mean magnetic field of this plasma. $S$ is a source term
representing the injection of the charged particles. They interact with the
background plasma via isotropic and elastic scattering off fluctuations of the
plasma's mean electromagnetic fields. $\nu$ is the corresponding scattering
frequency. $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{B}$, $S$ and $\nu$ are the input of the
simulation and can be analytical functions of $t, \mathbf{x}$ and $p$. The
distribution function $f$ is its output.

@sapphire tries to exploit that the distributions of energetic and charged
particles are in many physical environments almost isotropic. It, thus,
expresses $f$ as a series of spherical harmonics, i.e.

$$
 f(t, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}) = \sum^{\infty}_{l = 0} \sum^{l}_{m = 0}
 \sum^{1}_{s = 0} f_{lms}(t, \mathbf{x}, p) Y_{lms}(\theta,\varphi) \, ,
$$

where $\mathbf{p} = p \, (\cos\theta, \sin\theta \cos\varphi, \sin\theta
\sin\varphi)^T$ is used. The zeroth order term is the isotropic part and higher
order terms represent the anisotropies of the distribution function. @sapphire
computes the expansion coefficients $f_{lms}$, hence it solves a system of
partial differential equations (PDEs), which is derived from the above VFP
equation.

A distinguishing feature of @sapphire is that it solves this system of PDEs by
applying the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method. The dG method is a finite
element method which is particularly suited for the shown VFP equation.

The full implementation details can be found in @cite Schween2024a and
@cite Schween2025.

Even though primarily developed in the context of cosmic-ray physics, @sapphire
can be applied in the context of inertial confinement fusion, or for example to
compute the transport of radiation (interpreting $f$ as the intensity).

# Installation {#installation}

You can install @sapphire either [from source](#install-from-source)
or use [Docker](#docker).

## Install from source {#install-from-source}

### System requirements {#requirements}

@sapphire uses the C++ library @dealii to solve the differential equations with finite elements.
We use MPI to parallelize @sapphire.
For optimized parallel grid generation and linear algebra operations,
we use [p4est](https://www.p4est.org) and [PETSc](https://petsc.org)
through their interface in @dealii.
In order to compile and use @sapphire you need the following programs installed:

- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version @cmake_min_version or later
- [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Open-MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org)
- [Threading Building Blocks (TBB)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB)
- [boost](https://www.boost.org)
- [zlib](https://zlib.net)
- [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) with MPI support

To install @dealii and all necessary prerequisites for @sapphire,
we provide an
[installation script](https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp/blob/main/scripts/install-dealii.sh).
Download the script and it with run the script by executing:

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp/refs/heads/main/scripts/install-dealii.sh
chmod u+x install-dealii.sh
./install-dealii.sh

### Compiling @sapphire {#compilation}

You can obtain @sapphire either as a tarball from the
[release page](https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp/releases),
or by cloning the `git` repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp.git
```

Afterwards you can compile @sapphire, with `cmake` and `make`:

```shell
cd sapphirepp
export DEAL_II_DIR="path/to/deal.II"
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEXAMPLES=ON
make --directory=build
```

Developers are advised to use the following `cmake` options:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DEXAMPLES=ON -DTESTS=ON -DDOC=ON \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wno-ignored-optimization-argument" \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY="clang-tidy-19;--extra-arg=-Wno-error=unknown-warning-option" \
      -DCLANG_FORMAT_EXECUTABLE="clang-format-19"
```

@note Do not forget to switch to the optimized `Release` build
      before starting extensive simulation runs.

## Install using Docker {#docker}

A pre-built [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) container is available on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapphirepp/sapphirepp).

1. **Pull the container from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapphirepp/sapphirepp):**

   ```shell
   docker pull sapphirepp/sapphirepp:latest
   ```

2. **Start the container (no edits):**

   To use the precompiled version of @sapphire use:

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -ti -u root -v $(pwd)/results:/home/dealii/sapphirepp/results sapphirepp/sapphirepp:latest bash
   ```

   Results will be saved in your local `results` folder.

   @note Any changes to source files in the container will be lost after closing the container.

3. **Start the container with persistent source access:**

   To keep changes to the source code,
   clone the @sapphire repository
   and mount it to the container:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp.git
   docker run --rm -ti -u root -v $(pwd)/sapphirepp:/home/dealii/sapphirepp sapphirepp/sapphirepp:latest bash
   ```

   Now you can edit files on your host and compile inside the container:

   ```shell
   cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEXAMPLES=ON
   make --directory=build
   ```

   Results will be saved in your local `sapphirepp/results` folder.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

To run @sapphire, you need to provide a parameter file:

```shell
./build/sapphirepp parameter-template.prm
```

You enable parallel execution by using `mpirun`:

```shell
mpirun -np N ./build/sapphirepp parameter-template.prm
```

where `N` is the number of processors to use.
